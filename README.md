# Natural-Selectio-nColor-Optimizer-w-Genetic-Algorithm


This is my first attmept at implimenting the Genetic Algorithm.

It works by taking the most fit squares(closest to the background color) and having them produce 4 offspring, which may have mutations
This does not include crossing over.
It is just a x chance to change the darkness level by y
